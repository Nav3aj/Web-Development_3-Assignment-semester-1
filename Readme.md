## Lab Title
Portfolio Website Using HTML, CSS and Basic JavaScript

## Description
This is my portfolio website created for Lab 3.  
It contains a header, hero section with a typing effect, an about me section, skills, projects, and a simple contact form.  
The purpose of this lab was to practice basic web designing and also to make the layout responsive for different screen sizes.

## How to Check Responsive Behaviour
To see how the website looks on different devices, follow these steps:

1. Open the website in Google Chrome.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and click **Inspect**.
3. Click the **Toggle Device Toolbar** (mobile/tablet icon).
4. Try resizing the screen manually or choose the following device sizes:
   - 320px (small phones)
   - 480px–768px (phones and small tablets)
   - 1024px and above (laptops/desktops)

I tested it on these breakpoints:
- **Below 480px** – mobile size  
- **480px to 768px** – tablet size  
- **Above 768px** – laptop/desktop size  

This helped me check if text, cards, and layout adjust properly on smaller and larger screens.
